I frequently turn to [Codepen](https://codepen.io/) or browser dev tools to swiftly test out a new idea.

My requirements are straightforward:

- I want to draft JavaScript code quickly.
- I want immediate visibility of the output.
- I want to share my concept effortlessly.
- I don't want to rely on specialized tools.
- I want to embed it on any desired page.
- I want the flexibility to embed a code snippet and also edit it.
- It have to be super simple.

Since I also wanted some basic syntax highlighting, indentation, themes, etc, I used [Codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) but the playground
works equally well just with a `textarea` element.
