As a child, one of the toys I had was a sliding-numbers puzzle. It consisted of a simple plastic frame containing 8 numbered squares that could move one spot at a time. To solve the puzzle, you had to slide each square, one by one, into the free space until all the numbers were in order:

```
1 2 3 
4 5 6 
7 8  
```
