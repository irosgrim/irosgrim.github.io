I wanted to see how easy/hard is to do a state manager that would work with React.js. There is no reason for this to not work equally well with any other front-end library.
Is this an adequate solution? 
I don't know but I successfully used it in some of React.js experiments and had no noticeable issues.
The code is pretty straight forward and the idea is based on the `Observer Pattern`.

I decided to make it into a `npm package`.
