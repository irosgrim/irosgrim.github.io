[Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) is one of the first games I had installed on my first PC and I remember having lots of fun playing it.
In tribute to this classic puzzle game, I've developed my own version.

Creating maps by hand was a painful process, so it made sense to built a level editor as well.

I used this mini game as an opportunity to experiment with:

 - event bus architecture
 - scaling canvas
 - working with sprites
 - input control
