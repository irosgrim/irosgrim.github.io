A popular initial programming exercise often recommended in schools is to build a calculator. 

Building a calculator is a pretty fun experience; you have the flexibility to make it as basic or intricate as you want.

In JavaScript, many (including me), are tempted to use the `eval` function, given its direct approach to evaluating arithmetic expressions. However, a better alternative exists in the form of the [shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm).
