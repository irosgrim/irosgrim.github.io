[Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) is one of the first games I had installed on my first PC and I remember having lots of fun playing it.
As a homage to a great puzzle, here is my own implementation.

Since I found it was painful to create the maps/levels manually, I decided to make a level editor too.
