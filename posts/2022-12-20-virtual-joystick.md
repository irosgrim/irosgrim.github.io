While creating small, simple games in Vanilla JavaScript and without dependencies, I started to realize that mobile control is close to impossible.
Here is a mobile virtual joystick experiment.

The only game i'm using this code in is my [Snek game](https://irosgrim.github.io/snek/) for now but soon I will use it in more.
