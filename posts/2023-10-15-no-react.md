There's no reason to avoid using just HTML, CSS, and JS. In fact, most of the time, these are the only tools required to create websites. That's why I decided against using any front-end framework for this site. Instead, I opted to create all the posts as Markdown files, which will be parsed upon pushing to the repository using GitHub Actions.
