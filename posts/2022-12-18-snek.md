One of the first games I played on a mobile phone was `The snake`. It was on Nokia phone, long time ago.
Here is an exercise where I wanted to apply a few ideas: 
- having obstacles generated from `.png` [files](https://github.com/irosgrim/snek/tree/main/src/imgs): 
- being able to destroy obstacles. You get "bullets" by eating specific type of food

Of course, like most of the stuff on this page, unpolished, unfinished.


### Link to source code:

[snek](https://github.com/irosgrim/snek)

### In action:

Refreshing the page will generate new obstacles.

Shoot by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> key.
